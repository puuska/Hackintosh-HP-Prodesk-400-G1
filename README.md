## Improvements
- This version was prepared using OpenCore 0.6.1 for MacOS Big Sur.
- SSDT was generated for i3-4130. Use https://github.com/Piker-Alpha/ssdtPRGen.sh to optimize yours CPU power management and then paste it into EFI/OC/ACPI/ssdt.aml
- Everything is working; sleep, USB, sound (dodgy way there!). Even Checkra1n doesn't have any problem with detecting your iPhone in DFU mode.
## Installation

### First-time installation
- First of all, go to the UEFI settings and disable the serial port. Upgrade the BIOS to the newest possible version (currently the newest version is version no. [00.02.56, Rev.A](https://ftp.hp.com/pub/softpaq/sp96001-96500/sp96015.exe) which was released on the 30th of April 2019).
- Copy OpenCore to EFI partition or USB drive. In contrast to Clover, you need to have BOOT\bootx64.efi file.
- Simply put your Big Sur install USB into any port and select Install macOS option in OpenCore.

### Issues
- VGA Display output isn't working
- TV app is working but it is not stable at all. Sidecar is not working.
- VoodooHDA... Can't get AppleALC to work. OpenCore documentation is just a piece of sh*t.
